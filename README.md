## What are Common Procurement Fraud Schemes?

In practice, procurement fraud can be carried out in a number of ways, usually with the employee and vendor working together. 

Procurement employees award a vendor a contract and get something for themselves in return. An employee might do this because they:
  
o	Have a personal connection to the vendor: The vendor is the employee’s family member or friend. By awarding the vendor the contract, the employee enjoys fulfilment in their relationship and/or shares in the financial rewards of the contract. 

o	Are a silent partner of the vendor: The employee is secretly part owner of the vendor’s business and will experience financial gain when the vendor wins the contract. 

o	Receive bribes and kickbacks: The vendor offers the employee gifts or a share of their earnings in exchange for a contract. These could include anything from money to membership at a country club to luxury goods.

## FRAUDS IN E-GROCERIES FIELD 

Online groceries were often thought of as one of the most predictable ecommerce segments; loyal customers with recognisable buying patterns, typically at their home address, making it easier to spot suspicious activity. 

Now, with more people feeling comfortable buying online, wanting to shop around for the best prices and quickest delivery slots, and open to trying out new digital services, there are more accounts being opened and behaviour is less predictable — which is where the fraud problem for these online grocery merchants accelerates. 

Grocery merchants confessed that there are top three fraud risks: online payment fraud (73%), account takeover or ATO (65%), and friendly fraud (58%).
 
To address these challenges, grocery merchants are spending an increasing amount of time manually reviewing transactions. 

To combat fraud effectively, the grocery sector needs to consider introducing a combination of machine learning and customer behaviour analysis to provide a robust layer of defence. 


###	So our task is to develop system which can identify pattern and that pattern will detect the fraud. 

###	Our job is to detect the fraud, to build the model, to replicate the customer and to decide the scope.
